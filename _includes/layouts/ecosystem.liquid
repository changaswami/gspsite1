                    The Shoe: Your Proof of Stake in Reality.
                </h3>
                <p>More than just a wearable, "The Shoe" is a political tool. It verifies your real-world, pro-social actions—from organizing a local clean-up to participating in a global protest—and translates them into undeniable political capital.</p>
                <p>Utilizing on-device AI, it captures context and verifies contributions, ensuring that your tangible efforts are recognized and recorded as true value.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>This is not a currency for buying goods. The Step Token is a governance token for making decisions. The more you contribute to the collective good, the more voting power you earn.</p>
                <p>It's a system designed to give power to the active, the engaged, and the constructive, ensuring that influence aligns with genuine contribution, not just inherited wealth or existing power structures.</p>

                    The March: Our Assembly.
                </h3>
                <p>No longer just a personal journey, "The March" is our decentralized public square. It's where we debate issues, propose solutions, and vote on actions.</p>
                <p>It is where we coordinate our collective will, ensuring that every citizen has a platform to contribute to global problem-solving and collective decision-making.</p>
